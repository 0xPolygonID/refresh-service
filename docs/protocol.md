# Refresh service

## Description

In some cases, having mechanisms to refresh issued credentials can be helpful. 
A refresh service allows credentials to be updated by the user client. This approach ensures that users are consistently using the updated information provided by the issuer, such as a user balance, a game score, or other data that can be frequently updated.

## Example

Consider an example of balance credentials, where a user proves his balance to get some benefits. The balance can be changed a lot during a short period. In this case user needs to interact with the issuer every time he needs to use the credential. This is where the refresh service comes in handy. The refresh service can handle necessary data updates on the background of the user client without additional interaction between the issuer and the user.

## Changes in the verifiable credential

In protocol level, the revocation service is integrated into the W3C verifiable credential:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    ...
  ],
  ...
  "refreshService": {
	"id": "https://refreshService.example", // iden3comm agent endpoint
    "type": "Iden3RefreshService2023"
  }
}
```

The data model of `refershService`:

| Field name | Data type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | string | Type of refresh service. | âœ… |
| id | string | URL to [iden3comm](https://iden3-communication.io/) agent endpoint | âœ… |

Supported types:
- Iden3RefreshService2023

## Algorithm of client interaction with refresh service

To implement credential refreshing, we need to follow next algorithm to look up for the credentials when a proof request is received:

![auto-refresh.drawio.svg](assets/auto-refresh.drawio.svg)

**Select all credentials that satisfy context + type**

- Looking for credentials based on a specified context and type. If found, go to the next step. Otherwise, return an error.

**Credentials are found, check the skipRevocation flag**

- Check the value of the `skipRevocation` flag from the proof request. **true**, you should skip the revocation check and move to the next step. If **false**, process the revocation check.

**Check revocation for selected credentials**

- `skipRevocation` flag is false, verify whether the selected credentials have been revoked. If all credentials are revoked - return an error.

**Select all credentials that are non-expired and matched to the proof request**

- This step involves filtering out credentials that are expired and(or) don't match the proof request. If non-expired and matched to proof request credentials were found. Generate a proof.

**Valid credentials are not found, filter all credentials that have a refresh service**

- The algorithm filters out credentials that have a refresh service.

**Select credential**

- From the credentials with refresh services, select one and initiates a refresh. After refreshing, save new credential.

**Check if the refreshed credential satisfies the proof request**

- After refreshing the credential, checks if the updated credential satisfies the proof request. If it does, generate a proof. If the credential still doesn't meet the proof request, the process repeats, selecting another credential with a refresh service and refreshing it.

>ðŸ’¡ **NOTE:** If expired credentials are revoked, the current recommended algorithm will not process or update such credentials.

## Client communication with refresh service:

If the refreshServer section within a verifiable credential is of type **Iden3RefreshService2023**, the client is required to construct a  [refresh Iden3Comm ZKP message](https://iden3-communication.io/credentials/1.0/refresh/). This message should then be sent to the agent endpoint specified by `refreshServer.id`.

## Possible refresh service implementation:

Workflow:

![General flow.svg](assets/work-flow.svg)

1. The verifier initiates a proof request to the holder.
2. The holder attempts to locate credentials based on the request.
3. The holder verifies the expiration date.
4. The holder sends a `Refresh request` to the `refreshService` within the verifiable credential.
5. The `refreshService` sends a request to the issuer node to retrieve claim information.
6. The issuer node provides the claim details to the `refreshService`.
7. The `refreshService` validates the VC's expiration date.
8. Using the VC's `credential type + context`, the `refreshService` selects a data provider and makes a request.
9.  The `refreshService` contacts the `issuer node` to create a new claim using the data received from the data provider.
10. The `issuer node` generates the refreshed claim and sends it to the `refreshService`.
11. The `refreshService` delivers an [issuance response](https://iden3-communication.io/credentials/1.0/issuance-response/) to the holder's mobile app or extension.
    
    **Signature (SIG):**
    
    1. The `refreshService` provides the refreshed credential to the holder.
    2. The holder can generate a proof for the signature request.
    
    **Merkle tree proof (MTP):**

    > **NOTE:** The workflow for MTP is in development. However, you still can receive notifications about MTP proof on the mobile application after refreshing credential(-s) that have MTP proof are performed.
    >

    3. The `refreshService` informs the holder about the `pending` status.
    4. The holder monitors the credential status for a certain duration.
    
    **In cases where the holder intends to generate proof for an MTP proof request but their credential has been refreshed, the holder should decline the proof request. This is because generating an MTP proof might require a significant amount of time to become ready.**

## Integration examples:

1. Golang integration:
    1. Issue a credential with RefreshService and use the RefreshService to generate proof: https://github.com/iden3/identity-server/pull/309
    2. Issuer a credential with RefresService only: https://github.com/0xPolygonID/issuer-node/pull/581
2. JS integration:
